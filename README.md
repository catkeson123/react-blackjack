# Blackjack Game

A game of Blackjack built in React in which the standard rules of blackjack apply (dealer must hit until above 17, aces can be both 1 or 11, both dealer and player bust above 21, etc.). The game gives the player 100 chips to start out and allows them to bet these chips at the start of each hand. The player has the option to either continue with an existing game (if they still have chips remaining) or start a new game at any point.
